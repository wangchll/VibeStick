# Hardware

## Supported Device

VibeStick v0.1.7 targets M5Stack StickS3.

The project does not currently claim support for other devices because the UI layout, front button behavior, microphone path, speaker path, PMIC battery reads, and screen size are all written around StickS3.

## Hardware Used

- Screen: LVGL UI on the StickS3 display.
- Blue front button (`KEY1`, GPIO 11): long press records push-to-talk audio until release. For 30 seconds after a successful recording, single click sends the focused draft and double click stops the current Codex turn.
- Large right-side button (`KEY2`, GPIO 12): single/double click switches views and handles pending approval; a 700 ms long press clears the latest pasted voice draft.
- Corner power button: device power and firmware download-mode control; it is not an application input and is distinct from `KEY2`.
- Microphone: StickS3 microphone captured as 16 kHz / 16-bit / mono PCM.
- Speaker: ES8311 / I2S playback for generated agent status tones.
- Wi-Fi: HTTP communication with the Mac bridge on a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network. StickS3 / ESP32-S3 does not support 5 GHz Wi-Fi.
- USB-C: flashing and serial monitor.
- Battery / USB power: local PMIC reads for the battery UI.

## Firmware Configuration

Install ESP-IDF v5.5.x once before building or flashing firmware. Follow Espressif's [ESP-IDF v5.5.1 ESP32-S3 guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.5.1/esp32s3/get-started/index.html), or use:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/esp && cd ~/esp
git clone -b v5.5.1 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
cd esp-idf && ./install.sh esp32s3
```

Create a local secrets header:

```sh
cp firmware/sticks3/include/vibe_stick_secrets.example.h firmware/sticks3/include/vibe_stick_secrets.h
```

Edit:

```c
#define VIBE_STICK_WIFI_SSID "your-wifi"
#define VIBE_STICK_WIFI_PASSWORD "your-password"
#define VIBE_STICK_BRIDGE_HOST "192.168.1.10"
#define VIBE_STICK_BRIDGE_PORT 8765
#define VIBE_STICK_BRIDGE_TOKEN "paste-generated-token-here"
#define VIBE_STICK_SPEAKER_VOLUME 85
```

`VIBE_STICK_SPEAKER_VOLUME` accepts `0`–`100` and controls the generated completion, approval, and error tones. VibeStick Setup writes this value automatically when it builds and flashes the firmware.

Do not commit `vibe_stick_secrets.h`.

The Wi-Fi network must be 2.4 GHz. If the SSID is a combined 2.4/5 GHz network and the StickS3 cannot connect, create or select a dedicated 2.4 GHz SSID.

## Roxy Animation Assets

The firmware uses a 96 x 104 device adaptation of the local Codex custom pet at `~/.codex/pets/roxy-pixel/spritesheet.webp`. It includes idle, running, approval, done, and error animations. Frames use a shared 31-color palette and a small PackBits-style codec, then decode into a 20 KB RGB565 buffer in PSRAM.

To regenerate the checked-in C assets and deterministic QA previews:

```sh
python3 firmware/sticks3/tools/generate_roxy_assets.py --qa-dir /tmp/vibestick-roxy-qa
```

The generator validates the canonical atlas dimensions and SHA-256 before writing `firmware/sticks3/generated/vibe_roxy_assets.c` and `.h`. The original local Codex atlas is not checked into the repository or bundled by the installer.

## Flashing

Load ESP-IDF into every new terminal before running `idf.py`:

```sh
. $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh
```

Adjust the path if ESP-IDF is installed elsewhere. If you see `command not found: idf.py`, this shell has not loaded ESP-IDF yet.

From the firmware directory:

```sh
cd firmware/sticks3
idf.py build flash monitor
```

If automatic flashing fails, put the StickS3 into download mode and retry:

1. Plug the StickS3 into the Mac with a USB-C data cable.
2. Long-press the side power button until the blue LED double-blinks and the screen turns off.
3. Run `ls /dev/cu.*` to find the serial port.
4. Retry `idf.py -p <port> build flash`.
5. After flashing, short-press the power button to wake the screen. The blue LED should turn off and the VibeStick home screen should appear.

## Runtime Network

The StickS3 talks to the Mac bridge by HTTP. The Mac bridge should listen on `0.0.0.0:8765` when the device is on the same Wi-Fi network.

Use only a private, trusted LAN. HTTP does not encrypt the shared Bridge token sent with protected requests; do not expose port `8765` to the internet. The firmware image also contains the configured Wi-Fi password and Bridge token. If a device is lost, rotate both credentials as appropriate, then reflash it.
