# Contributing to VibeStick

Thanks for your interest! VibeStick is an early-preview project — bug reports, ideas, and
pull requests are welcome.

## Project layout
- `firmware/sticks3/` — ESP32-S3 firmware (C, ESP-IDF v5.5.x)
- `bridge/` — local macOS bridge service (Python, standard library only)
- `app/macos/` — minimal HUD (Swift)
- `scripts/`, `docs/`

## Dev setup & checks

Bridge (Python 3.11+):

```sh
    python3 -m compileall -q bridge/src tests
    PYTHONPATH=bridge/src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Firmware: install ESP-IDF v5.5.x (see README), then `cd firmware/sticks3 && idf.py build`.
CI runs the bridge checks on every push / PR.

## Guidelines
- No third-party Python dependencies — the bridge uses only the standard library; keep it that way.
- Never commit secrets — keep keys/tokens/Wi-Fi creds in the gitignored `.env` and
  `vibe_stick_secrets.h`; don't log tokens or raw API responses.
- Match the surrounding code style; add/update tests for behavior changes.
- Don't change status icons / generated assets without discussion.
- For every delivered update, increment all product versions, rebuild the self-contained installer, and verify its bundled and managed templates. Use the installer for final Mac installation and firmware flashing; see `AGENTS.md` and `app/macos/README.md`.

## Pull requests
1. Fork and create a branch. 2. Make focused commits with clear messages.
3. Ensure the checks above pass. 4. Open a PR describing what changed and why.

## Issues
- Bugs / features: open a GitHub issue.
- Security: see SECURITY.md — report privately.
