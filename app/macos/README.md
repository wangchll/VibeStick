# VibeStick macOS Developer Notes

This document covers development and delivery details for the macOS apps. For normal installation, see the root [README](../../README.md).

This directory contains two separate macOS components:

- `VibeStickSetup` is the native SwiftUI setup app. Its three-step wizard collects Wi‑Fi, StickS3 alert-volume, and optional cloud voice-input settings, finds the StickS3 automatically, then prepares the toolchain, builds and flashes firmware, explicitly starts the device after flashing, installs the Bridge/menu-bar app, and verifies the result. The installed menu-bar app switches among cloud API, local Whisper, and WeChat Input modes. Advanced fields, diagnostics, and technical logs stay out of the main path.
- `VibeStickHUD` is the small AppKit recording-status overlay installed with the Bridge LaunchAgent.

## Run the setup app

VibeStickSetup is a SwiftPM app that requires macOS 14 or newer:

```sh
./script/build_and_run.sh
```

The script builds `app/macos/Package.swift`, embeds a clean VibeStick project template, and stages the app at `dist/VibeStickSetup.app`. It prefers a Developer ID Application identity, then Apple Development, and falls back to an ad-hoc signature when neither exists. Other supported modes are `--debug`, `--logs`, `--telemetry`, and `--verify`.

For a release artifact, use `./script/build_and_run.sh --package`. It creates a hardened-runtime, universal (`arm64` + `x86_64`) release build without opening the app and verifies the resulting bundle. A Developer ID Application certificate and notarization credentials are still required before it can be described as a trusted public macOS distribution.

Run its tests with:

```sh
swift test --package-path app/macos
```

## Release discipline

Every delivered change increments the shared patch version across Bridge, firmware, Setup, installed menu-bar About text, and installer metadata. Run `./script/build_and_run.sh build`, launch the resulting installer to refresh its managed `InstallerProject`, and verify changed deployable files match across the repository, bundled template, and managed template. Template refresh must preserve `.env` and `vibe_stick_secrets.h`; both Mac installation and firmware flashing are performed through this installer.

## Current delivery boundary

This is a developer-preview installer, but the built `.app` is self-contained: it embeds only the audited firmware, Bridge, HUD, and installer sources required for deployment. On first launch those signed resources are copied to `~/Library/Application Support/VibeStick/InstallerProject`; updates replace that workspace while preserving its `.env` and firmware secrets. The app never scans the bundle's parent directories, so it can be moved away from the checkout and does not require Documents-folder access. If Python 3.11+ is unavailable, it downloads a pinned, checksum-verified Python 3.12 runtime. A first-time firmware build also downloads ESP-IDF and tools (about 1 GB). Xcode Command Line Tools are still required; the app opens Apple's system installer and rechecks automatically when they are missing.

A public installer should instead ship a notarized app, signed privileged/helper components where required, a versioned and signed firmware manifest, precompiled universal firmware, and a small per-device NVS configuration image. That removes the source checkout, Git, Xcode Command Line Tools, and the full ESP-IDF download from the normal user path.

The app never writes secrets to UserDefaults. The current VibeStick runtime still requires Wi‑Fi credentials in the firmware header and ASR credentials in `.env`; those files are written atomically with mode `0600` and mirrored to a versioned macOS login-Keychain namespace for form reuse. Startup Keychain reads are explicitly non-interactive, so stale entries from an older development signature cannot block launch or show repeated password dialogs. The Data Protection backend remains reserved for a correctly entitled release build. Technical logs are bounded and redact all managed secrets, inherited proxy credentials, and terminal control characters. Only a non-secret interrupted-flash recovery flag is kept in UserDefaults.
